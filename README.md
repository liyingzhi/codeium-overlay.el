This simple, unofficial Emacs package let's you extend the functionality of [Exafunction's Codeium Emacs package](https://github.com/Exafunction/codeium.el), allowing the user to receive code completion suggestions in an overlay instead of through a completion mechanism, similarly to how it works in other editors.

You must install and set up [codeium.el](https://github.com/Exafunction/codeium.el) beforehand. Then simply place `codeium-overlay.el` in your load path, and require 'codeium-overlay. Completions are provided per-buffer by `codeium-overlay-mode`.

Contributions to this repository are gratefully welcome.
